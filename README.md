# Operating Systems
I focused on creating a multilevel feedback queue scheduler and managing resource usage between different processes, developing an interpreter to read and execute code from three program files, as well as implementing a memory management system to store processes. Additionally, I implemented mutexes to ensure mutual exclusion over critical resources and designed a scheduler using the multilevel feedback model scheduling algorithm. 
I started by developing an interpreter to read and execute the provided program files. 1 program takes two numbers as input and prints all numbers between them inclusively. Another program takes a filename and data as input, then creates the file with the given filename and writes the data to it. The last program takes a filename as input and prints the contents of this file. Each program was designed to use semWait and semSignal instructions to manage resource access and ensure mutual exclusion.
To manage processes, I implemented a Process Control Block (PCB) for each process. The PCB contained essential information such as the process ID, state, current priority, program counter, and memory boundaries. For memory management, it was divided among the processes based on their order of arrival, to store instructions, variables, PCB data and three variables.
As for the implementation of the multilevel feedback queue scheduler, this dynamic priority-based scheduling algorithm, where the quantum doubles as the priority decreases (increases from 1 for the highest priority level to 8 for the lowest priority level), ensures efficient process scheduling and execution.
To ensure mutual exclusion over critical resources, I implemented mutexes to manage access to shared resources such as file access, user input, and screen output. The semWait and semSignal operations were used to acquire and release these resources, ensuring that only one process could access a resource at a time. 
This project not only enhanced my understanding of operating system functionalities but also prepared me for more complex system-level programming challenges in the future.
